Describe what open source means.
-Open source when referring to code means that the code is open for all to view and edit. The creators of the code are not profitting by selling the software, rather they are furthering the open source community and likely producing a better product.
What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
-I think open source is a great idea. You can certainly get more places and get there faster when collaborating with people who are only motivated by their own inherent interest and desire to improve the work. The obvious downside is you aren't making money by selling the software. But I think just like many fields have had to change their business model because of emerging technology, there are probably ways to have open source code and still be able to make a profit, perhaps indirectly.
Assess the importance of using licenses.
- Licenses establish what a user can do with a given open source code. In many cases, the license looks to protect the rights of the original creator so that they receive some degree of credit in the code's usage. If you submitted something into the public domain with no license, then you would of course have no rights whatsoever with what anyone would do with it.
What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
- A lot of the git workflow was solidified for me on this challenge. I made a few silly mistakes and definitely got lost a few times with what the next move should be, but overall I'm quite happy with how it went and feel I have a solid foundation for git, GitHub, and working on the command line going into Week 2!
Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
A couple of times I read some posts on stack overflow to just hear some different voices on how to handle git workflow.
