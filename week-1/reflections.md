#1.1 Think About Time Reflection
Which time management and productivity ideas did you learn about?
- In doing some research, the ideas that kept coming back up were the pomodoro technique and meditation/mindfulness. The pomodoro technique has a student give 100% attention to a task for a set period of time, then take a break for a set period of time before repeating the cycle. It helps you give full focus to the task while you are working, but the built in breaks keep you from working yourself into a haze. The breaks also help your brain go into something called the diffuse mode, where new ideas can become ingrained in your long term memory and be recalled more easily. Meditation/mindfulness generally looks for you to establish clear thoughts and reduce visceral or emotional reactions. Rather you observe that you feel a certain way, but you don't become or act out those thoughts. Both mindfulness and pomodoro suggest that you will retain new information and concepts best when you sort of allow your brain to digest the information in a natural way over a period of time rather than trying to jam everything in at the last second.

What is "Time Boxing?" How can you use it in Phase 0?
A time box is a preset, agreed upon amount of time devoted to working on a project. Once the time is up, you evaluate what you were able to accomplish. The pomodoro technique is a version of this. I could use it in Phase 0 to help myself be super focused on taking in new concepts for a period of time without becoming overwhelmed. Taking breaks also helps to retain the information you recently learned and gives you the ability to call it from memory later on.

How do you manage your time currently?
I do a less structured version of the pomodoro technique and a vague meditation-like routine. Overall, I'm able to get what I need done, but there are times when I can be a bit rushed at the last minute, or overwhelmed by too much material at once. If I was a little more organized I think it would reduce these problems.

Is your current strategy working? If not, why not?
My current time management is pretty good, but I could definitely improve. I have a tendency to let my mind wander and go over time in both the focused and diffuse modes. I currently set time boxes with general parameters and loosely follow them. This leads to some wasted time and some degree of frustration.

Can/will you employ any of them? If so, how?
I will definitely look to be more organized and have more strict time box start and stop times and try to stick to them. This starts with simply scheduling my week with more structure and prioritizing the things that I need and want to do. But there were definitely tips that I researched that have given me some ideas and encouragement in employing better time management.

What is your overall plan for Phase 0 time management?
Schedule my week on Sunday, accounting for how much time should be spent on DBC assignments, then spacing out work sessions with the pomodoro technique in mind. On top of that, allocate time to do some fun diffuse style activities to keep my sanity and also help to solidify some of the new concepts that I'm taking in.
##1.2 The Command Line
What is a shell? What is "bash?" - The shell is a user interface that allows the user to create, edit, delete, etc. files and directories. Bash is a particular shell that runs in the command line.
What was the most challenging for you in going through this material? - Using the <,>,| operators to redirect orders.
Were you able to successfully use all of the commands? - Yes!
In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know? - mkdir, rmdir, cd, touch. Just for the sheer number of times that you have to use them.
Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.
-pwd

prints working directory

-ls

lists all files and directories

-mv

renames a file

-cd

changes directory

-../

allows you to go up one or more levels in the directory: cd ../.. (goes up two levels)

-touch

creates an empty file

-mkdir

makes a new directory

-less

a pager that prints the text of a file in a new window and allows you to page up and down

-rmdir

removes a directory

-rm

removes a file

-help

 gives you a ton of information that might help you figure out an issue you are dealing with



###1.4 Forking and Cloning
If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be?
Create an account on GItHub. Find a repository that you want to fork. Click the fork button. Forking repo done. Copy and paste the HTTPS clone url. In the command line, navigate to the folder you would like to clone to and type "git clone" followed by the HTTPS url you copied. Cloning repo done.

Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?
If you find a repo that you think you could add something worthwhile to, you would fork a branch of your own to then work on and add features. This is one of the crucial things that GitHub provides: collaboration on projects. If your code turns out to be as affective as you hoped, it could be merged into the master code.

What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
I found this exercise to be pretty straightforward. It really is as simple as just clicked the buttons as instructed. But I did find myself not entirely sure what I was doing at first. I was getting the desired outcomes but I didn't really know what each step was achieving. After looking over the instructions a few times and repeating the steps I feel like I've got the steps memorized and have a solid understanding of what each thing is doing. Awesome
