Project 1
-Input: array of numbers
-Output: the sum of the numbers in array
-Steps:
  Define a function that accepts an array as arg
  Create a variable = zero
  Iterate over the array, += each value in the array to the variable
  Return the variable

Project 2
-Input: array of numbers
-Output: mean of the numbers in array
-Steps:
  Define a function that accepts an array as arg
  Create a variable = zero
  Iterate over the array, += each value in the array to the variable
  Divide the variable by the length of the array and return the answer

Project 3
-Input: array of numbers
-Output: median(middle value in sorted list) of the list of numbers
  Define a function that accepts an array as arg
  IF array.length is even
    sort the array
    find the values at the middle 2 indexes
    return whatever number is inbetween those two values
  ELSE (the array.length is odd)
    sort the array
    return the value at the middle index
