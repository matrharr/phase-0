  Version Control
  </h1><p>Version control is a crucial component to writing code, and one way to do it is through using git and the website GitHub. Version control is basically the idea that as software(or any project actually) is developing, you will want to try out experimental ideas with your code that may or may not be something you want in the final product. In order to do this, you create "branches" off of the master code that allow to explore different possibilities. If the new feature doesn't break everything and turns out to be something good, then you can merge it back to the master code. Having the ability to move around like that is already great, but another huge component of Version Control is the organization of the edits. Being able to look back and see all the commits and even restore the master branch to a previous state are huge tools in effectively writing code. Git is a great version control system because it allows you to do all of these things pretty easily with relatively straightforward syntax. Simple arguments like "git status," "git add," and "git commit" give the user a lot of power and make it a easy tool to get things done.</p></article>

<p>To clone a repo go into the repo and click the "copy to clipboard" button to copy the clone url.  In terminal "cd" in to your git directory.  Enter "git clone "clone url"" into the command line.</p>

<h1>What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?</h1>

I struggled to properly read the instructions.  I learned that I needed to take a short break and go back into it and it was a breeze.

If you were going to write instructions for a new person on how to create a new repo, fork a repo, and clone a repo, what would they be? Why would you fork a repository as opposed to create a new one?</h1>

<p>To create a new repo click the the "+" icon at the top right corner of the screen and click "new repository".  Enter the name of the new repo and click "create repository".</p>

<h1>To fork a repo click "fork" button below the "+" icon on the top right corner of the screen.  Select which profile you would like to for the repo to.</h1></section>


<!--
what HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often?
-We used article and section in this challenge. I come back to those pretty often because they acurately describe the content.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
-Elements get laid out in the order you place them from top to bottom.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date? What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
-I learned that you can access and create snippets, which is like a premade skeleton of tags. I think you can do this for any programming language. I might create more, it depends if as I keep creating html pages if I find myself repeatedly writing out the same tags to a tedious degree. To be honest, I'm not sure how convenient creating and using snippets is in a practical scenario. I could research some snippets online, perhaps there are sort of preset tag skeletons that would accurately describe a page that I wanted to make.
