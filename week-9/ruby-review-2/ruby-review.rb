# Create a Playlist from Driver Code

# I worked on this challenge with: Emily Bosakowski.
# I spent [2] hours on this challenge.


# Pseudocode

### Playlist methods:
### takes splat number of elements
#initialize
# add
# num of tracks
# remove
# includes
# play_all
# display

### song methods:
### takes 2 arguments
#initialize
# play


# Initial Solution

# class Song

#   def initialize(track, artist)
#     @track = track
#     @artist = artist
#   end

#   def play
#     p "And next on the hopper, we have the new hit single by #{@artist} that's burning up the charts. [airhorn sound]. This iiiis, #{@track}!"
#   end

#   def display
#     p @artist
#     p @track
#   end

# end

# class Playlist < Song

#   def initialize(*tracks)
#     @tracks = tracks
#     # @the_list = Song.new(@tracks)
#   end

#   def add(*new_song)
#     @tracks = @tracks.concat(new_song)
#     p @tracks
#   end

#   def num_of_tracks
#     return @tracks.length
#   end

#   def remove(song_to_remove)
#     p song_to_remove
#     @tracks.each do |song|
#       if song == song_to_remove
#         @tracks.delete(song)
#       end
#     end
#   end

#   def includes?(song_to_check)
#     # p song_to_check
#     @tracks.each do |song|
#       if song == song_to_check
#         return true
#       end
#     end
#     false
#   end

#   def play_all
#    @tracks.each do |song|
#      song.play
#    end
#   end

#   def display
#     @tracks.each do |song|
#       song.display
#     end
#   end

# end

# Reflection
# What concepts did you review in this challenge?
# What is still confusing to you about Ruby?
# What are you going to study to get more prepared for Phase 1?
