What is a wireframe?
-A wireframe is a skeleton of how you want your website layout to appear. It can be done with special software or even with pencil and paper.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
-It allows extreme flexibility in customizing the layout of your website. You can move buttons, links, lists, and tables around in order to find what is most user friendly and puts forth the info that you want your audience to find easily. It seems like most good decisions in website UX design come from being flexible and sort of playing with everything at your disposal until you hit an aha! moment and its looks the way you want.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
- I did actually. I went into it a little annoyed, wanting to spend my time learning more technical things, thinking site design was a little too subjective to really care about, but it turns out I liked it! The program I used was really easy and it was pretty fun to mess around with it.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
-There were lots of little revisions. I just took it step by step, started at the top and worked my way down. If something didn't seem right, I would make small adjusments until it looked better. In general, my final product is kinda close to what I initially had in mind.

What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
-I just sort of wondered what makes good looking sites so attractive. I looked at a few sites and just took note of the design, thought about how they arranged their content to put forth their most important info.

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
-I enjoyed playing arount with the wireframe program and thinking about how I wanted my site to look. I thought some of the reading was a little tedious, just in that a lot of it was repetitive and it essentially kept saying "these rules are the convention, but if you can make it work, do whatever you want."
