<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
  It was relatively seamless. The main thing I was focused on was trying to keep the format readable with indents and spaces. Also, keeping track of tag placement is key. For a moment I placed the closing a tags in some wrong locations so I had to fix that.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
  It was a little confusing but I enjoyed it.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
  I think I did a good job. The code is readable and I think it follows best practices.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
  Its good because it works in a pretty straightforward way. I have trouble with it at times because it can be difficult to remember order of certain tags and what tags should be nested in other tags, and it also seems particularly easy to make syntax errors in html.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
  I don't really have tricks, but I kind of have a mental image of the structure, what tags go where, which are nested, where to indent. So when I'm writing it, I just try to stay with that picture.
